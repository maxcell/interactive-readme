# Interactive Lessons

Readmes don't engage the student. Their attention might drift, and their focus might not be on the new fact or content that we are introducing. They also might not understand the content, and aren't required to demonstrate understanding as they read. 

This demo shows a few features that indicate what interactive readmes might look like.

Interactions in this demo:
- Click to advance
- Fill in the blank == Writing (elisions)

Other imagined interactions:
- Multiple choice
- Indentation
- Code reordering via drag-n-drop
- writing (blocks)
- writing (larger problems / open ended)
- card swipe (yes / no)
- card swipe flashcards (memory prompts)

## Getting Started

It's vanilla html, css, and js! Open up index.html in a browser!


## Context

Flatiron nov '19 internal hackathon project, Rob Cobb and Prince Wilson. Will this project go anywhere after this? who knows! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
